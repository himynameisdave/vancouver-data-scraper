# vancouver-data-scraper

Very simple scrapers for various public Vancouver datasets. These make use of GitHub actions which are set to run on a cron schedule, then simply commit the changes to the dataset to the repository (if there are any). Inspired by [this post](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/).

Plans to eventually add something to tweet or post these changes out to the world is something I'd like to eventually add here.
